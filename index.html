        <p>Reading is a good hobby that will not only improve your imagination but also allows you to escape your daily routine. When you read a good book you can really get lost in the story. A book gives you the chance to escape your daily reality and experience a whole new world!One of the reasons why reading is the best hobby is because it expands your horizons. It gives you something new and different to enjoy.You can learn practically anything from reading a good book on the subject. Even if you choose to read fiction, you may learn something that is helpful in your life.When we read, not only are we improving memory and empathy, but research has shown that it makes us feel better and more positive too. Science has shown that reading has some amazing health benefits, including helping with depression, cutting stress, and reducing the chances of developing Alzheimer's later in life.</p>
